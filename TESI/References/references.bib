abstract="The flight duration of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) is limited by their battery or fuel capacity. As a consequence, the duration of missions that can be pursued by UAVs without supporting logistics is restricted. However, a system of UAVs that is supported by automated logistics structures, such as fuel service stations and orchestration algorithms, may pursue missions of conceivably indefinite duration. This may be accomplished by handing off the mission tasks to fully fueled replacement UAVs when the current fleet grows weary. The drained UAVs then seek replenishment from nearby logistics support facilities. To support the vision of a persistent fleet of UAVs pursuing missions across a field of operations, we develop an improved mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model that can serve to support the system's efforts to orchestrate the operations of numerous UAVs, missions and logistics facilities. Further, we look toward the future implementation of such a persistent fleet outdoors and develop prototype components required for such a system. In particular, we develop and demonstrate the concerted operation of a scheduling model, UAV onboard vision-based guidance system and replenishment stations.",

abstract={Recent advances in interference cancellation and signal-processing techniques can enable full-duplex radios and multipacket reception (MPR), which will have significant impact on medium access control (MAC) schemes. In this paper, we propose a MAC scheme in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) ad-hoc networks with full-duplex radios and MPR. To efficiently handle the highly mobile environment of a UAV ad-hoc network, a token-based technique is used to update information in the network as well. The MAC schemes in the presence of perfect and imperfect channel state information (CSI) are formulated as a combinatorial optimization problem and a discrete stochastic optimization problem, respectively. Simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed MAC.},

abstract="In recent years, the capabilities and roles of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have rapidly evolved, and their usage in military and civilian areas is extremely popular as a result of the advances in technology of robotic systems such as processors, sensors, communications, and networking technologies. While this technology is progressing, development and maintenance costs of UAVs are decreasing relatively. The focus is changing from use of one large UAV to use of multiple UAVs, which are integrated into teams that can coordinate to achieve high-level goals. This level of coordination requires new networking models that can be set up on highly mobile nodes such as UAVs in the fleet. Such networking models allow any two nodes to communicate directly if they are in the communication range, or indirectly through a number of relay nodes such as UAVs. Setting up an ad-hoc network between flying UAVs is a challenging issue, and requirements can differ from traditional networks, Mobile Ad-hoc Networks (MANETs) and Vehicular Ad-hoc Networks (VANETs) in terms of node mobility, connectivity, message routing, service quality, application areas, etc. This paper identifies the challenges with using UAVs as relay nodes in an ad-hoc manner, introduces network models of UAVs, and depicts open research issues with analyzing opportunities and future work.",

title="Optimal placement of UV-based communications relay nodes",
journal="Journal of Global Optimization",
year="2010",
volume="48",
number="4",
pages="511--531",
abstract="We consider a constrained optimization problem with mixed integer and real variables. It models optimal placement of communications relay nodes in the presence of obstacles. This problem is widely encountered, for instance, in robotics, where it is required to survey some target located in one point and convey the gathered information back to a base station located in another point. One or more unmanned aerial or ground vehicles (UAVs or UGVs) can be used for this purpose as communications relays. The decision variables are the number of unmanned vehicles (UVs) and the UV positions. The objective function is assumed to access the placement quality. We suggest one instance of such a function which is more suitable for accessing UAV placement. The constraints are determined by, firstly, a free line of sight requirement for every consecutive pair in the chain and, secondly, a limited communication range. Because of these requirements, our constrained optimization problem is a difficult multi-extremal problem for any fixed number of UVs. Moreover, the feasible set of real variables is typically disjoint. We present an approach that allows us to efficiently find a practically acceptable approximation to a global minimum in the problem of optimal placement of communications relay nodes. It is based on a spatial discretization with a subsequent reduction to a shortest path problem. The case of a restricted number of available UVs is also considered here. We introduce two label correcting algorithms which are able to take advantage of using some peculiarities of the resulting restricted shortest path problem. The algorithms produce a Pareto solution to the two-objective problem of minimizing the path cost and the number of hops. We justify their correctness. The presented results of numerical 3D experiments show that our algorithms are superior to the conventional Bellman-Ford algorithm tailored to solving this problem.",
